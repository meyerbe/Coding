NCO = NetCDF Operators

statisticians: ncra, nces, 
concatenators: ncwa, ncrcat, ncecat
>> ncrcat is designed for concatenating record variables, while ncecat is designed for concatenating fixed length variables. 

(1) concatenate files: ncecat
-----------------------------------
ncecat *.nc merged-file.nc
-----------------------------------
aggregates an arbitrary number of input files into a single output file using using one  of  two  methods.
Members of an ensemble may have no reason to contain a record dimension. ncecat will create a new record dimension (named record by default) with which to glue together the individual files into the single ensemble file.

Record  AGgregation (RAG),  the  traditional  method  employed  on (flat) netCDF3 files and still the default method, stores input-files as consecutive records in the output-file.
Group AGgregation (GAG) stores input-files as top-level groups in the netCDF4 output-file.

A new RECORD DIMENSION is the glue which binds together the input file data.  

-----------------------------------
correct time dimension: 
for filename in *.nc; do
  ncks -O --mk_rec_dmn time ${filename} ${filename}
done



(2) extract single variable
cdo selvar foo file.nc foo.nc
ncks -v u 100.nc u_100.nc

(3) merge fields with variables
ncks -h -A u_merged_t0_t3600_k1.nc v_merged_t0_t3600_k1.nc



1. Adding a record dimension.

What you should do, for the first file (and only the first file of your list of files to be concatened), is the following command :
-------
ncks -O --mk_rec_dmn time_dimension_name in.nc out.nc
